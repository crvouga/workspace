# OpenTofu infrastructure

OpenTofu 1.13.0 is the only infrastructure manager. Resources are declared with published providers; no provisioning scripts, reconciler, shell provisioners or alternate IaC exist. Image building, local daemon startup, secret reads and HTTP probes remain application operations.

The canonical inventory is [modules/inventory/inventory.tf.json](modules/inventory/inventory.tf.json), in `locals.inventory`. It is OpenTofu JSON syntax, consumed directly by OpenTofu and read-only documentation/build adapters. There is no parallel YAML inventory.

All state and saved plans are encrypted with OpenTofu's PBKDF2/AES-GCM support. `foundation`, `bootstrap`, `vault` and `fleet` use locked R2 S3 backends. The legacy Fly API returned no apps, so there are no surviving Fly resources to adopt.

`state` keeps its own encrypted local state to break the backend bootstrap cycle; back it up outside the repository with its passphrase. Never delete the only copy of that state.

## Existing fleet migration

Production adoption completed on 2026-10-01. All five roots were imported or adopted, applied, and verified with zero-change plans before enabling `TOFU_MIGRATION_READY`. Existing service identities, image revisions, database contents and the admin password were preserved. The original initialization record and encrypted bootstrap state are backed up outside the repository.

The steps below document adoption for recovery or another environment. Import blocks declare identities; verify the actual state and plans before enabling CI in any new environment. Obtain the original OpenBao initialization record and existing credentials securely, and preserve them throughout adoption.

1. Install OpenTofu 1.13.0 and the [Atlas CLI](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started). Atlas uses a local disposable PostgreSQL dev database (`schema_dev_url`), defaulting to Docker's PostgreSQL 18. Supply a suitable dev URL if Docker is unavailable.
2. Use a password manager to create a random state passphrase of at least 32 characters. Supply `TF_VAR_state_passphrase`, `TF_VAR_cloudflare_account_id` and `TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token` without committing values.
3. Initialize and plan `state`; apply its saved plan. Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from its sensitive `access_key_id` / `secret_access_key` outputs. Set the matching `TF_VAR_state_access_key` / `TF_VAR_state_secret_key` for the GitHub bootstrap bindings. Preserve the encrypted local state and the passphrase independently.
4. Create an ignored `backend.backend.json` in each remote root. Use the example below, changing the root's state key. Initialize each root with `-backend-config=backend.backend.json`. Supply the same settings without `key` as `TF_VAR_state_backend` in `vault` and `fleet`. Credentials come from the AWS environment; never embed them in backend configuration.
5. Supply required provider inputs using ignored tfvars or `TF_VAR_*`. `foundation` requires an account-scoped Railway token, a GitHub PAT with repository/Actions/workflow permissions, a Neon API key and `vault_inputs`. `vault_inputs` is JSON containing **complete** `secrets.dev`, `secrets.prd` and `admin_passwords`. Export every existing KV field into that input before adopting KV resources; applying a partial map would remove omitted fields. Do not log or commit the export. Derived infrastructure fields and generated runtime credentials are managed by resources and override matching manual fields.
6. Import the existing Railway project and Neon project. Import every service, custom domain and existing variable collection using the addresses below. Keep current image tags and current schema configuration while adopting. Add import blocks for remaining existing resources rather than allowing duplicate creation. Atlas owns `secret_store` only; its schema preserves the storage tables and migration-history table. Inspect its schema diff for destructive changes.
7. Import `bootstrap`'s `vaultoperator_init.vault` from a protected file containing the original initialization output (`keys`, `keys_base64`, `root_token`). Recover it from the existing `crvouga.kv` record through a trusted database session if necessary. **Do not initialize a new seal against the existing database.** The encrypted bootstrap state replaces the old script's reliance on that database row. The row is retained as application data; no script mutates it.
8. Import the KV mount, policies, auth backends/roles, users and both KV documents into `vault`. The current runtime token can be replaced with the managed periodic token only as part of a reviewed rotation. Preserve existing `TURBO_TOKEN` and 9router credentials in `secrets` during adoption so clients keep working.
9. Review saved plans for all roots. Resolve every proposed destroy/replacement and duplicate before applying. Apply in order: `foundation`, `bootstrap`, `vault`, `fleet`, serially with `-parallelism=1`. Then verify every public endpoint and a remote-cache write/read. Set the foundation input `migration_ready = true` and apply it only after adoption and checks; it enables the OpenTofu-managed `TOFU_MIGRATION_READY` repository variable. CI fails closed until this variable is true.

  "skip_requesting_account_id": true,
  "skip_metadata_api_check": true,
  "use_path_style": true,

}
```

Providers without import support (Railway settings) adopt existing configuration through their initial create/update operation; review their desired values before applying. A locally managed tunnel must be migrated to remote ingress without replacing its UUID; verify the Cloudflare provider's plan and connector cutover before applying.

Cloudflare 5.26.0 also cannot import `cloudflare_zone_dns_settings`. Its initial create operation edits the existing zone's singleton DNS settings; review that update rather than adding an unsupported import block. SOA and nameserver TTL overrides require Cloudflare Enterprise entitlement. The inventory deliberately omits them so the provider preserves Cloudflare defaults rather than submitting unsupported custom settings. Neon represents an unrestricted IP allowlist with an omitted (`null`) optional attribute because its provider rejects an explicit empty list.

## Normal operations

`bun run infra`, `infra:bootstrap`, `infra:vault`, `infra:fleet` and `infra:state` forward arguments directly to OpenTofu. Review with `plan`; apply the reviewed saved plan. Stateful resources use `prevent_destroy`; decommissioning requires an explicit reviewed OpenTofu change, never an API deletion script.

CI uses [.github/actions/tofu](../../../.github/actions/tofu/action.yml) for initialization, saved plans and serialized applies. It preserves all existing service image revisions when changing a subset of services. Local fleet plans must supply the complete deployed `image_tags` map from `tofu output -json image_tags`; incomplete maps fail validation. Application image building remains Docker CI work. Railway pulls the existing public GHCR images without private registry credentials. There is no visibility-setting bypass script or dashboard instruction.

GitHub publisher files are `github_repository_file` resources rendered from [the shared template](modules/inventory/publish.yml.tftpl). The integration guide renders that same template. Resource edits, new hosting entries and secret values all go through OpenTofu.

The foundation root is authoritative for every platform repository's configurable GitHub control plane. Every repository has managed metadata and features, default branch, Actions policy and default workflow-token permissions, security scanning, vulnerability alerts and Dependabot security updates. The workspace repository additionally owns its ruleset, collaborators, issue labels, Actions secrets and Actions variables. Git history, pull requests, issues, workflow runs, releases, packages and artifacts are application or collaboration data rather than infrastructure resources.

Repository secret names are declared in `github.repositories[*].actions_secrets` in the inventory. Their values already live in GitHub Secrets. OpenTofu lists metadata and imports existing secrets without needing or copying plaintext values into Vault. It ignores secret value and rotation timestamp changes, and prevents deletion; a missing name is omitted from adoption and reported in `unavailable_repository_secrets`. The schema-only empty value is never written during adoption, as verified with the real pinned provider against a mock API that rejects every mutation. Bootstrap credentials and newly generated secrets retain their existing OpenTofu value ownership.

Optional credential-dependent integration checks report `SKIP` for missing, malformed or rejected credentials and continue independent checks. CI runs these in `secret-integrations`, outside the core `check` / `Required` gate. Local `check:ci` attempts a bounded Vault read and always runs core checks with local caching. Actual core failures still fail the suite; an active deployment's required credentials and production smoke test still fail that deployment. Public health probes and fleet OpenTofu deploys do not import unrelated third-party credentials.

The credentials that let OpenTofu reach each provider, the state-encryption passphrase and the initial state-backend credentials are bootstrap trust anchors. They must be supplied from outside the state they unlock. Scoped credentials created after that boundary—including state and object-store tokens—are OpenTofu resources.

Validate with `bun run check:infra`; regenerate the integration guide with `bun run llms:sync`. Never commit state, saved plans, initialization files, secret tfvars or credentials.
