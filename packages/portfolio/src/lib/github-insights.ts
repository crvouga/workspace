/**
 * Uptime policy for the proof section.
 *
 * Order of preference:
 *   1. live GitHub data (retried on transient failures), which also refreshes
 *      the committed snapshot;
 *   2. the committed snapshot, rendered with a visible "cached" caption that
 *      states how old it is;
 *   3. nothing — a notice card in `astro dev`, a hard build failure otherwise.
 *
 * Step 2 is why a GitHub incident, an expired token, or a rate-limit window
 * cannot take the site's build down. It is deliberately *not* why the data is
 * fresh: freshness comes from the scheduled rebuild in ci.yml, and a snapshot
 * old enough to mean that schedule has stopped working is logged loudly here so
 * the failure surfaces in CI instead of only on the page.
