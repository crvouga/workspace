# @pkgs/portfolio

Source for [www.chrisvouga.dev](https://www.chrisvouga.dev): an Astro 7 static site, its content registry, generated assets, resume PDF, and container image.

The package is a Bun workspace inside `crvouga/workspace`. The production image (`ghcr.io/crvouga/chrisvouga-portfolio`) is built from the repository root by CI using `packages/portfolio/Dockerfile`, then served by nginx. Hosting is declared in [`packages/infra/services.yaml`](../infra/services.yaml) (`id: portfolio`).

## Architecture

Astro static output emits a small set of HTML pages — `/`, `/projects/`, `/404` — each with its CSS inlined and no client framework. Runtime JavaScript is limited to copy-to-clipboard feedback, the native project gallery dialog, and the lazy YouTube embed. There is no analytics or runtime API dependency except the embedded video.

`src/content/**` is a typed TypeScript registry (projects, work, school, topics, skills) shared by the site, the resume PDF, and the screenshot job list.

### Resume PDF

`/chris-vouga-resume.pdf` is **generated during `astro build`**, not committed. [`src/pages/chris-vouga-resume.pdf.ts`](src/pages/chris-vouga-resume.pdf.ts) assembles [`src/resume/content.ts`](src/resume/content.ts) from the same modules the site renders — the hero statement becomes the summary, `work.ts` highlights become the bullets, the homepage's featured side projects become Projects, and skills are ranked by how often those projects use them. So the PDF cannot drift from the site: editing content is the only way to change it.

Rendering is Playwright's Chromium ([`src/resume/pdf.ts`](src/resume/pdf.ts)), which keeps the text a real text layer for applicant tracking systems. Because the build shells out to Chromium, the Docker build stage is Debian with `playwright install chromium`, and CI installs it before `bun run check`.

Every candidate layout must pass all four checks before its bytes are returned, and a candidate that fails any of them is reduced (per [`src/resume/reductions.ts`](src/resume/reductions.ts)) and re-checked:

| Check               | Catches                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rendered height     | Content taller than the printable area — the usual overflow.       |
| Element bounds      | Anything crossing the page edge, e.g. an unbreakable URL, clipped. |
| Empty sections      | A section heading left with no rows after trimming.                |
| Real PDF page count | A second page, checked on the actual bytes rather than assumed.    |

Trimming never drops a role, and the page is filled before anything is cut. When a trim happens the build prints `[resume] trimmed to fit one page: …`, so content outgrowing the page is visible rather than silent. If every reduction is exhausted the build fails with what was left, so a broken resume can never deploy. `src/resume/pdf.test.ts` renders the real PDF and asserts these properties, including for deliberately oversized content and an unbreakable URL.

`@astrojs/sitemap` generates `sitemap-index.xml` + `sitemap-0.xml`; there is no `public/sitemap.xml`. `nginx.conf` deliberately does **not** fall back to the homepage — an unknown path is a real 404 serving `dist/404.html`.

GitHub proof data is fetched at build time by [`src/lib/github.ts`](src/lib/github.ts) using `PORTFOLIO_GITHUB_TOKEN` (a user token with `read:user`). The proof section offers a period picker — the trailing twelve months plus every calendar year back to the one the account was created in (the profile's `created_at` bounds it; years with no contributions are dropped). All periods are fetched in one aliased GraphQL document, and the picker CSS is index-independent, so adding years needs no CSS change. Shades are quartiles of each period's own active days rather than GitHub's fixed 1/3/6/10 buckets, which would saturate a high-volume account into a single flat colour. The picker itself is pure CSS (`:checked` sibling rules), so it works without JavaScript.

### Build-time uptime

A GitHub incident, an expired token, or a rate-limit window must not be able to take the build down. [`src/lib/github-insights.ts`](src/lib/github-insights.ts) applies, in order:

1. live GitHub data, retried with backoff on network errors, 429, and 5xx — a success also rewrites the snapshot;
2. the committed snapshot [`src/data/github-insights.json`](src/data/github-insights.json), rendered with a visible `Last known snapshot …` caption;
3. otherwise a notice card in `astro dev`, or a hard build failure in production.

The snapshot is a normal source file so it is present in the Docker build context. Every successful build rewrites it (days are stored as a first-day date plus a flat count array, one number per line, to keep diffs small) — **commit it** to move the offline fallback forward. `astro dev` never writes it.

The preferred local entry point is `bun portfolio`, which wraps the dev server in `vault run --config dev` and always starts `astro dev --force`.

## Local development

Install the workspace once from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
```

Preferred development command (Vault injects the dev secrets and `--force` clears Astro's content-layer cache):

```bash
bun portfolio
```

Equivalent package command with a local token:

```bash
cp packages/portfolio/.env.example packages/portfolio/.env
# edit packages/portfolio/.env and set PORTFOLIO_GITHUB_TOKEN
bun run --filter @pkgs/portfolio dev
```

Build through Vault:

```bash
bun portfolio:build
```

Run the full local generation pipeline (hosted screenshots + optimized derivatives):

```bash
bun run --filter @pkgs/portfolio gen
```

Image sources are committed under `assets/`; only optimized WebP derivatives are served from `public/`. After adding or changing a source, run:

```bash
bun run --filter @pkgs/portfolio assets:optimize
bun run --filter @pkgs/portfolio assets:prune
```

The Docker E2E is intentionally local-only:

```bash
vault run --config dev -- bun run --filter @pkgs/portfolio test:docker
```

## Content

`projects.ts` is the source of truth for project listings. Entries are split across `src/content/projects/entries-part-1.ts` and `entries-part-2.ts` to stay under the repository file-size limit; append new projects to `entries-part-2.ts`.

`entries-archive.ts` holds early and small work (games, toys, client sites) as `ARCHIVE_PROJECTS`. It is deliberately **not** part of `PROJECTS`, so it never reaches the homepage, the Toolbox stack, the screenshot jobs, the resume or the URL health check — `/projects/` renders it behind the "Everything else" fold so nothing built is lost. Descriptions may contain trusted HTML (`<a class="inline-link" …>`); the Projects section renders them with `set:html`.

Work highlights are authored in `src/content/work.ts` and are rendered by both the site cards and the resume bullets. `src/content/skills.ts` is shared by the About Toolbox and the resume.
